#Description: It is a file transfer program with the UNIX file permissions.For example, assume Alice wants to make her schedule available to Bob. She places a copy of scopy in her public directory at /home/alice/public/scopy, verifies that Bob will be able to access it, and sets
its SetUID bit with chmod u+s scopy. She also creates appropriate permission data so Bob can access her
daily schedule.txt.
# Run the Program by just typing : make run
